Write a Javascript function that shifts the first letter of every word in a sentence to the position of the first character in the next word. 
The first letter in the last word becomes the first character of the first word.
```js
function shiftFirst(sentence){
// write your code here
}
console.log(shiftFirst("Today is Sunday")); // "Soday Ts iunday"
console.log(shiftFirst("The Sun rises in the East")); // "Ehe Tun Sises rn ihe tast"
```
