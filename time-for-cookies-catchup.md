Christmas Eve is almost upon us, so naturally we need to prepare some milk and cookies for Santa! 

Create a function that accepts a month, and day, and returns `true` if it's Christmas Eve (December 24th) and false otherwise. Keep in mind JavaScript's Date month is 0 based, meaning July is the 6th month while January is 0.


## Examples
```js
timeForMilkAndCookies(11, 24); // should return true

timeForMilkAndCookies( 0, 23); // should return false

timeForMilkAndCookies(11, 24); // should return true
```
