#### NOTE: Do all 3 parts in one function

## Part1
Create a function with two parameters a and b that calculates the sum of all the numbers between a and b and returns it.
Both a and b are included in the sum.You can assume that a will be smaller than b.


***CODE TEMPLATE***
*********************
```js

// write your code here
console.log(sumBetween(5, 8));//
console.log(sumBetween(6, 12));//63
```
*********************
## Part2

Modify the function in Part1 to include the possibility when a is greater than b 

```js
console.log(sumBetween(10, 8));//27
```

## Part3
Modify the function to include the possibility that a can be equal to b. In that case the function should just return either of the two numbers.

```js
console.log(sumBetween(6, 6));//6
```
