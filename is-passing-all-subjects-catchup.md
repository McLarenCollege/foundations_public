A student receives letter grades for three subjects: Math, English, and Science. The letter grades are represented as strings: "A", "B", "C", "D", and "F". Write code to determine whether the student has a passing grade in all subjects. A passing grade is "C" or better.

```js
let mathGrade = "A";
let englishGrade = "B";
let scienceGrade = "C";

// Write your code here
let isPassingMath =;
let isPassingEnglish =;
let isPassingScience =;
let isPassingAllSubjects =;
```
