- Class recordings will be available two hours after the class and the link will be shared on the channel.
- recording might be published on You Tube. Students can choose to keep their camera off during the class but that would mean they wont be able to ask questions.
- You may take 1 day's leave for the entire duration of the course with 24 hours notice.
- You need to put in your leave request in your course specific form, and once your instructor approves the leave, you are permitted to take it
- If you are absent you will have to spend extra time outside of class hours to make up for missed coursework
- If you are not able to attend the class for any **substantial** reason then will will give you access to the class video
- We may drop you from the course at any time if we find your attendance or work unsatisfactory, or if your behaviour is unprofessional
- Make sure you have a working laptop/ desktop computer for the course .

### Technical Issues
- You must have a good internet connection and a fast computer with good audio and video capability
- Ensure your laptop and phone and power bank are charged before class.
- In case of power cuts you must join the zoom call on your phone and continue the class.
- In the rare even that the instructor loses internet connection please stay online and check the Discord channel for instructions.
 

### Assignments and  Deadlines
- Every day we will give you in-class challenges and homework which you must submit by 10:00 am IST the next working day which is the soft-deadline for the challenge.
- If you fail to submit the assigments correctly by the next day it indicates you need more practice, so we will assign you more catchup challenges that you will need to complete within 3 days after the challenge was assigned which is the hard-deadline .
- The original challenge and the catchup challenge will be due by the hard-deadline.
- If your assignment submission is not acceptable we will ask you to re-submit it
- To avoid a strike you must submit correct solutions by 10:00 am IST on the third day after the work was assigned

### Strikes and Warnings
- We will give you a strike if:
    - You fail to complete an assignment withing 3 days
    - You are absent without any prior notice
    - You are repeatedly late for class
    - You have technical issues and your working equipment is not in place
- We will drop you from the course if you accrue 3 strikes
- We will drop you from the course if you are found involved in cheating

### Cheating is Unacceptable
> "We look for three things when we hire people. We look for intelligence, we look for initiative or energy, and we 
> look for integrity. And if they don't have the latter, the first two will kill you, because if you're going to 
> get someone without integrity, you want them lazy and dumb."
>  -- [Warren Buffett](https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-hire-people-with-integrity-heres-how-to-find-them-9?r=AU&IR=T) 

This course is designed to test all three of these qualities: your ability, your energy and your integrity.  If we catch you cheating you have failed the test of integrity, and we will immediately drop you from from the course and ban you from any future courses.  The 3-strike rule does not apply to cheating.

#### What is Cheating?
Cheating is being dishonest about who performed the work you submit or how much time you took to do it.  For example:
- Copying chunks of code from the internet without adding a comment link to the source
- Gaining access to an assignment question before other students
- Looking up the solution to the assignment on the internet 

#### What Is Not Cheating?
It's fine to use Stack Overflow or Google to find out how to do things *which are not a large component of the assigment* - in fact this may be required for many assignments.  For example:
- You might look up an example of creating an object with properties in Javascript 
- You might Google 'javascript how to put a list of strings together separated by a comma' in order to discover the `join` method
- You might copy-and-paste a useful function from the internet, as long as you add a link to the source in the function comments and as long as the function is not the main goal of the assigment

### Class Etiquette
- Be responsive during the class especially if the instructor is asking a question.
- Avoid sending private zoom  messages to the instructor during the class.
- If you have a doubt please ask verbally or post it on Discord.
- Do not post your code on the question gists shared by the instructor.

### After the Course
- Completing this course is not enough to pass the entrance exam for our Algorithms and Data Structors course.  You will need *lots* of practice with Javascript
- We recommend you do many JS practice challenges on Edabit.com or Codewars.com
