Given Paul's age and Kim's age write code to print the following statements:

- If Kim is older print "Kim is older than Paul by *** years.".
- If Paul is older print "Paul is older than Kim by *** years.".

You can assume that Paul and Kim are not of the same age.

```js
let paulAge = 15;
let kimAge = 25;
// write your code here
```
